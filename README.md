# Email/SMS Spam Detection
## I developed Machine Learning Spam detection web app to classify the Emails or SMS as Spam or Not Spam.
## I used Spacy GloVe Word embedding for vectorization
## I used 2 machine learning classifiers Logistic Regression and SVM and compared the results
## SVM gave me 97% F1-Score for 'Spams' and 'Not Spams' while Logistic Regression gave me 95% F1-Score.
## I deployed my web app using Streamlit Cloud. https://email-sms-spam-detection-vbm4uupymsqjntdrwyew7i.streamlit.app/
